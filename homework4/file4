There is a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it is bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I shall lay your shit bare

See how I leave with every piece of you
Do not underestimate the things that I will do

There is a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And its bring me out the dark
